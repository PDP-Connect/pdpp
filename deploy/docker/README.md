# Deploy a PDPP Core node with Docker

The blessed self-service path is one pinned Docker Compose stack. It uses the
registry-proven `reference:sha-cc07e3a` and `web:sha-cc07e3a` images, publishes
the operator surface on port `3000`, and keeps the protocol listeners and
Postgres private.

For the one plain self-service journey — including Gmail setup, the health/data
gate, and Claude Code OAuth — use
[`docs/operator/self-service-gmail-mcp.md`](../../docs/operator/self-service-gmail-mcp.md).

## Pinned self-service Compose

[`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) runs the reference and console as
separate services on Postgres with pgvector. No repository clone required:

```sh
mkdir pdpp && cd pdpp
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PDP-Connect/pdpp/cc07e3a896c2c0df7841da4ec6b2c660ffe1e792/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml
printf 'PDPP_REFERENCE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/pdp-connect/pdpp/reference:sha-cc07e3a\nPDPP_WEB_IMAGE=ghcr.io/pdp-connect/pdpp/web:sha-cc07e3a\nPDPP_REFERENCE_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000\nPDPP_WEB_PORT=3000\nPDPP_OWNER_PASSWORD=%s\nPDPP_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=%s\n' \
  "$(openssl rand -base64 24)" "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
docker compose up -d
```

The compose file refuses to boot until both secrets exist in `.env` — the
owner password gates the dashboard, and the credential encryption key seals
any connector credentials you store. Keep `.env` with your backups.

Configuration knobs (all optional, set in `.env`):

```sh
PDPP_REFERENCE_ORIGIN=https://pdpp.example.com  # remote origin; local default http://localhost:3000
PDPP_WEB_PORT=3000                              # published console port
PDPP_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...                      # change if you ever publish Postgres
PDPP_EMBEDDING_DOWNLOAD_ALLOWED=0               # opt out of semantic search model download
```

To enable the API-backed Google Maps Data Portability source, create a Google
OAuth client for your PDPP origin and add the callback URL to Google exactly as
shown:

```sh
GOOGLE_DATAPORTABILITY_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_DATAPORTABILITY_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GOOGLE_DATAPORTABILITY_REDIRECT_URI=https://pdpp.example.com/_ref/provider-auth/callback
# Optional: comma-separated documented Maps resource groups; blank = connector default.
GOOGLE_DATAPORTABILITY_RESOURCE_GROUPS=
```

These are deployment-level OAuth app settings. They are not per-account Google
credentials, and a Gmail/Google app password cannot authorize the Google Data
Portability API.

**Browser-backed connectors (ChatGPT, USAA, ...):** the default `reference`
image is browser-free. A browser-enabled image is a separate, optional release
that must be verified in the registry before use; it is not part of this
Compose/Gmail/Claude Code path.

Serve a remote domain through your HTTPS reverse proxy (Caddy, Traefik, nginx)
pointed at the `web` port, and set `PDPP_REFERENCE_ORIGIN` to that domain so
owner-session cookies and OAuth metadata are correct. Local loopback HTTP is
supported for a local client; do not expose a remote node over HTTP.

## Verification

```sh
curl -fsS "$ORIGIN/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server" | head -c 200; echo
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' "$ORIGIN/connect"   # 307 -> /owner/login (gated)
```

Sign in at `$ORIGIN/owner/login`, then check `$ORIGIN/deployment` for the
runtime diagnostics surface (`GET /_ref/deployment`).

## Storage and upgrades

- Records live in the `pdpp-postgres-data` volume; secrets live in `.env`.
  Back up both together.

Upgrade by pulling and recreating; volumes persist:

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Update the reference and web image tags together, and run the registry manifest
check before moving to another published Compose release.

## Teardown

```sh
docker compose down --volumes                          # deletes data
```
