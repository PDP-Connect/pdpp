## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Connection Health SHALL Preserve Evidence Before Projection

The reference implementation SHALL model connection health as raw facts normalized into typed conditions and then into a derived projection.

#### Scenario: Raw credential failure becomes typed evidence

**WHEN** a connector run observes a source credential rejection
**THEN** the reference implementation records a `CredentialsValid` condition with `status=false`, a stable reason code, safe message, origin, observed timestamp, and remediation metadata.

#### Scenario: Projection is derived

**WHEN** a surface requests connection health
**THEN** the surface receives a projection derived from current conditions rather than independently inferring health from run history.

### Requirement: Conditions SHALL Be Typed, Current, And Safe

Every condition that can affect owner-facing health SHALL include a stable type, tri-state status, severity, reason, safe message, origin, observed timestamp, sensitivity, and optional remediation.

#### Scenario: Secret redaction

**WHEN** a credential or token-related failure is converted into a condition
**THEN** the condition message and remediation SHALL NOT include secret values and SHALL mark diagnostic sensitivity as `secret_redacted` when source details were redacted.

#### Scenario: Expired condition is not dominant

**WHEN** a condition has expired or is superseded by newer evidence for the same connection generation
**THEN** it SHALL NOT drive the dominant health projection.

### Requirement: Readiness SHALL Be First-Class

The reference implementation SHALL represent credential validity, runtime binding availability, remote surface availability, local exporter availability, and required external tools as readiness conditions when evidence exists.

#### Scenario: Missing runtime binding

**WHEN** a connector requires a browser surface and no usable surface is available
**THEN** the connection health SHALL expose a readiness condition explaining the missing runtime dependency.

#### Scenario: Unknown readiness remains explicit

**WHEN** no probe or failure evidence exists for a readiness dimension
**THEN** the reference implementation SHALL represent that readiness as unknown rather than guessing healthy or unhealthy.

### Requirement: Scheduler Policy SHALL Be Separate From Data Health

The reference implementation SHALL model scheduler backoff, paused schedules, and next due time as policy conditions separate from freshness, coverage, and last successful ingest.

#### Scenario: Newer success clears stale backoff

**WHEN** a connection has a scheduler backoff fact older than a successful run for the same connection generation
**THEN** the stale backoff SHALL NOT cause the connection projection to be blocked or failing.

#### Scenario: Active backoff is visible

**WHEN** retry policy is currently delaying the next run and no newer success supersedes it
**THEN** the connection projection SHALL expose `cooling_off` or equivalent policy state with retry timing.

### Requirement: Coverage, Work, And Attention SHALL Remain Decomplected

The reference implementation SHALL keep source coverage, local-device backlog, dead letters, retryable detail gaps, and owner attention as separate condition families.

#### Scenario: Successful run with partial coverage

**WHEN** a run succeeds but leaves terminal or retryable source gaps
**THEN** the projection MAY be degraded, but the underlying coverage condition SHALL identify the affected streams and recovery class.

#### Scenario: Local exporter has pending work

**WHEN** a local collector reports pending outbox records
**THEN** the connection projection SHALL expose pending device work without labeling the connection as a scheduler failure.

#### Scenario: Owner action blocks progress

**WHEN** a connector is waiting for current owner input
**THEN** `AttentionClear=false` or equivalent attention evidence SHALL dominate the projection until the request is satisfied, expires, or is canceled.

### Requirement: Owner Surfaces SHALL Share One Projection Contract

Dashboard, CLI, and owner-control-plane API surfaces SHALL consume the same connection health projection and condition contract.

#### Scenario: Dashboard and CLI agree

**WHEN** the same connection is listed in the dashboard and CLI
**THEN** the dominant state, reason, freshness, coverage, and remediation summary SHALL be derived from the same projection payload.

#### Scenario: Grant-scoped clients are isolated

**WHEN** a grant-scoped client queries records or streams
**THEN** owner-only diagnostics such as credential rejection details SHALL NOT be exposed unless a separate owner-debug authorization explicitly permits them.

### Requirement: Implementation SHALL Include Regression Evidence

The change SHALL include tests or scripted checks for the primary failure modes that motivated the evidence model.

#### Scenario: GitHub credential and stale scheduler regression

**WHEN** tests simulate a rejected GitHub token followed by a newer successful run
**THEN** the first projection SHALL show credential remediation and the second projection SHALL not be blocked by stale scheduler backoff.

#### Scenario: Local-device connection without scheduler run

**WHEN** tests simulate a local collector connection with retained records and no scheduler run
**THEN** the projection SHALL describe device ingest state rather than `never run` or generic failure.
