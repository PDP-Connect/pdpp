## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Stalled local-device outbox SHALL expose a visible operator remediation path

When the owner console surfaces a connection whose local-device outbox is stalled, it SHALL render the projection's remediation as visible operator copy and a copy-pasteable local command, not as hover-only text. The console SHALL NOT imply that the dashboard or a hosted service can drain a device-local outbox remotely.

The remediation command SHALL be deterministic and non-secret. It SHALL NOT include a base URL, bearer token, credential, or device-local filesystem path. It MAY be scoped by a non-secret connection identity already shown in diagnostics.

The remediation SHALL appear only when the outbox is stalled or when a current condition carries a `clear_backlog` remediation. Healthy, idle, active, and unknown outbox states SHALL NOT render remediation.

#### Scenario: Stalled outbox shows visible label and command

- **WHEN** the console renders a connection whose projection has `axes.outbox = "stalled"` or a current `clear_backlog` condition
- **THEN** the console SHALL render the condition's `remediation.label` as visible operator copy
- **AND** it SHALL render a copy-pasteable local collector diagnostic command for the operator to run on the host that holds the data

#### Scenario: Remediation command leaks no device-local internals

- **WHEN** the console renders the stalled-outbox remediation command
- **THEN** the command SHALL NOT contain a base URL, bearer token, credential, or local filesystem path
- **AND** it MAY include only a non-secret connection identity to scope the local diagnostic

#### Scenario: Non-stalled outboxes stay quiet

- **WHEN** the console renders a connection whose outbox is healthy, idle, active, or unknown and no current `clear_backlog` remediation applies
- **THEN** the console SHALL NOT render outbox remediation copy or a remediation command
