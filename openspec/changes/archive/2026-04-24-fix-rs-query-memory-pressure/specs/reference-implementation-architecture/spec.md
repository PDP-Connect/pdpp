## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The RS read-path for enumerated routes SHALL not materialize unbounded result arrays

The resource-server SHALL NOT execute a query whose result is an unbounded scan of a JSON-column table on the read paths covered by this change, which are:

- `GET /v1/streams/:stream/records` (including `expand=…`)
- `GET /v1/streams/:stream/records/:id` (including `expand=…`)
- `GET /_ref/runs`, `GET /_ref/grants`, `GET /_ref/traces`, `GET /_ref/search`
- `GET /_ref/records/timeline`

For these paths:

- Access-control filters (`time_range`, `resources`) SHALL be expressed as SQL `WHERE` clauses that constrain the scan at the storage layer.
- Pagination (`limit`, `cursor`, and per-parent limits in `expand`) SHALL be applied at the SQL layer via `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT` or window functions, not by loading the full set and `slice`-ing in application code.
- When a handler needs to iterate results, it SHALL stream via the driver's iterator API (e.g. `Statement.iterate()` in `better-sqlite3`) and stop as soon as the bounded page is assembled.
- Child-stream expansion SHALL filter the child scan by the parent page's foreign-key values **in SQL**, not fetch the whole child stream and group in application code.

Handlers MAY parse JSON columns into objects for the rows that survive into the response, but SHALL NOT parse JSON for rows that would be filtered out by access control.

This Requirement applies to the read paths enumerated above. Other read paths (if any) are out of scope for this change; bringing them under the same invariant is a follow-up.

#### Scenario: A grant narrows visibility via time_range

- **WHEN** a client queries `/v1/streams/<s>/records` under a grant that declares `time_range: { since, until }` on stream `<s>`
- **THEN** the SQL query the RS issues SHALL include a predicate that compares the row's `consent_time_field` against `since`/`until`
- **AND** rows outside the window SHALL NOT be parsed, materialized, or allocated in application memory

#### Scenario: A grant narrows visibility via resources

- **WHEN** a client queries `/v1/streams/<s>/records` under a grant that declares a non-empty `resources` allowlist on stream `<s>`
- **THEN** the SQL query SHALL include an `IN` predicate against the allowed record keys
- **AND** rows whose keys are not in the allowlist SHALL NOT be parsed or materialized

#### Scenario: Pagination is pushed into SQL

- **WHEN** a client queries `/v1/streams/<s>/records` with `limit=N` and optionally `cursor`
- **THEN** the SQL query SHALL emit `ORDER BY <cursor_field, primary_key>` and `LIMIT N+1`
- **AND** the RS SHALL read at most `N+1` rows from the driver, not the full filtered set

#### Scenario: Expansion pushes child-stream narrowing into SQL

- **WHEN** a client queries `/v1/streams/<s>/records?expand=<relation>&expand_limit[<relation>]=K` with a page of N parent rows
- **THEN** the SQL query over the child stream SHALL filter by `WHERE child.foreign_key IN (…N parent keys…)` plus the child grant's `time_range`/`resources` constraints
- **AND** the child query SHALL fetch at most `N × (K + 1)` rows for `has_many` expansions (via window function) or `N` rows for `has_one` expansions
- **AND** the RS SHALL NOT scan the child stream's full table

#### Scenario: Correlation-key listing pages in SQL

- **WHEN** a client lists `/_ref/runs`, `/_ref/grants`, or `/_ref/traces` with a page size
- **THEN** the SQL query SHALL aggregate in-SQL via `GROUP BY` and paginate in-SQL via `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT` + cursor
- **AND** the RS SHALL NOT materialize the full `spine_events` table to group in application code

#### Scenario: Records timeline applies time window in SQL

- **WHEN** a client queries `/_ref/records/timeline?since=A&until=B`
- **THEN** for each `(connector, stream)` pair it scans, the SQL query SHALL include a predicate against `COALESCE(NULLIF(json_extract(record_json, '$.<semantic_field>'), ''), emitted_at)` (native mode) or `emitted_at` (emitted mode) between the normalized `A`/`B` boundaries
- **AND** the query SHALL apply a per-pair SQL `LIMIT`
- **AND** the RS SHALL NOT scan and JSON-parse rows outside the window
